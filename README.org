* About
Pit AIs in a fight against each other! Only the strongest one remains.
* Details
For now, we will make some AIs that can solve the Gomoku problem. They will fight each other. The one equipped with better heuristic will reign supreme!

To ensure nondeterminism, we will use randomness to pick a optimal state among multiple state with similar utility value.

Students from all around BSSE12 will build and equip their own AIs! Our fight will be legendary..
